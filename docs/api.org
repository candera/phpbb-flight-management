** Query for Mission Types
*** Request

URL: /vfw440/api/query

- [ ] Do we want to have a WHERE clause?
  - Seems like we might be able to get by with virtual "views".

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  {
      "from" : "missiontypes",
      "select" : ["Id", "Name" ],
      "where" : [["=" "Active" true]]
  }
#+END_SRC

*** Response

- [ ] What about pagination? Necessary?

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  {
      "Results" :
      [
          {"Id": 1
           "Name": "Foo"},
          {"Id": 2,
           "Name": "Bar"}
      ],
      "Errors" : [],
      "Warnings" : []
  }
#+END_SRC
